# PostHog Analytics Setup Guide for ThreatWatch

## 🎯 Overview
I've implemented comprehensive PostHog analytics tracking for your ThreatWatch application to monitor the 5 key metrics you specified:

1. **Signups** → How many register, free vs. paid
2. **Searches per user** → Are they running 1 search or 50?  
3. **Report downloads** → Do they actually consume results?
4. **Drop-off points** → Are they searching but not downloading? Signing up but not searching?
5. **Revenue Tracking** → Subscription conversions, API cost monitoring

## 🔧 PostHog Cloud Setup (Required)

### Step 1: Create PostHog Cloud Account
1. Go to https://app.posthog.com/signup
2. Sign up for a new account (free tier includes 1M events/month)
3. Create a new project for "ThreatWatch"
4. Choose your data region (US or EU based on your users)

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys
1. In your PostHog dashboard, go to **Project Settings**
2. Copy your **Project API Key** (starts with `phc_`)
3. Go to your **Personal API Keys** section
4. Create a **Personal API Key** for dashboard access

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Update your environment files with the actual PostHog keys:

#### Backend (.env):
```bash
# Replace this placeholder with your actual PostHog Project API Key
POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_your_actual_project_api_key_here
POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com  # or https://eu.i.posthog.com for EU
POSTHOG_SYNC_MODE=False
POSTHOG_DEBUG=False
```

#### Frontend (.env):
```bash
# Replace this placeholder with your actual PostHog Project API Key  
REACT_APP_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_actual_project_api_key_here
REACT_APP_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com  # or https://eu.i.posthog.com for EU
```

### Step 4: Restart Services
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

## 📈 Key Dashboards to Create in PostHog

### 1. Business Metrics Dashboard
**Events to track:**
- `user_signup` → Filter by `plan_type` to see free vs paid
- `quick_scan_initiated` → Count per user to see search frequency
- `pdf_report_downloaded` → Measure actual consumption
- `subscription_change` → Revenue tracking

### 2. User Journey Funnel
**Create funnels for:**
- **Signup Funnel:** Page view → Auth modal → Registration → Success
- **Scan-to-Download Funnel:** Scan initiated → Scan completed → PDF generated → PDF downloaded
- **Conversion Funnel:** Signup → First scan → Limit reached → Upgrade → Payment

### 3. Drop-off Analysis Dashboard
**Track these funnel steps:**
- `funnel_scan_to_download_scan_initiated`
- `funnel_scan_to_download_scan_completed`  
- `funnel_scan_to_download_pdf_generated`
- `funnel_scan_to_download_pdf_downloaded`

### 4. Performance & Error Dashboard
**Monitor:**
- `api_performance` → Response times, error rates
- `frontend_error` → JavaScript errors
- `backend_exception` → Server-side errors

## 🔍 Real-time Insights Available

Once PostHog is configured, you'll have access to:

### Key Metrics (Your Top 5):

2. **Search Behavior:** Searches per user, popular queries, search frequency  
3. **Download Rates:** PDF generation vs download completion rates
4. **Drop-off Points:** Where users abandon the scan-to-download flow
5. **Revenue Tracking:** Subscription upgrades, cost per user, API usage costs

### User Behavior Insights:
- **Session Analysis:** Time on site, pages per session, bounce rate
- **Feature Adoption:** Which features are used most/least
- **Geographic Distribution:** Where your users are located
- **Device & Browser Analysis:** Technical user demographics

### Business Intelligence:
- **Conversion Rates:** Signup to first scan, scan to download, free to paid
- **User Retention:** Daily/weekly/monthly active users
- **Feature Performance:** Which queries generate the most downloads
- **Cost Analysis:** API costs per user, token efficiency metrics

## 📋 Testing Your Analytics

### 1. Backend Testing
```bash
# Check backend logs for analytics events
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log | grep -i posthog
```

### 2. Frontend Testing  
- Open browser developer tools
- Look for PostHog debug messages in console (if debug mode enabled)
- Check Network tab for analytics requests

### 3. PostHog Dashboard
- Go to your PostHog project dashboard
- Check "Live Events" to see real-time event tracking
- Verify user identification is working

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Privacy
- User emails are tracked for identification
- All analytics include proper user consent handling
- Error messages are truncated to avoid sensitive data leakage

### Performance Impact
- Analytics are designed to be non-blocking
- Events are batched to minimize performance impact
- Fallback handling prevents analytics failures from breaking app functionality

### Cost Management
- PostHog free tier: 1M events/month, 5K session recordings/month  
- Backend events are prioritized (authentication, scans, downloads)
- Frontend events capture user interactions and errors
