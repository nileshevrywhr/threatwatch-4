## 2024-05-23 - Empty States are Opportunities
**Learning:** Empty states (no search results, no data yet) are often dead ends. By adding a clear call-to-action (like "Clear Filters" or "Start New Scan"), we turn a dead end into a helpful guide.
**Action:** Always check if an empty state can guide the user to their next action.
